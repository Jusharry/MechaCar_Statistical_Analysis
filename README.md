## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Based on the results from the regression performed we can reject the null hypothesis as there are multiple factors that fall below the determinate p-value; namely the intercept(b),ground clearance and vehicle length as seen in the following screenshot

It is also clear from the results that the slope of the linear model is NOT zero. This is based on the fact that including the intercept point the variables of ground clearance and vehicle length have p-values significantly lower than the normal level of 0.05.It should also be noted that the  vehicle weight factor is within 3 % of falling within the desired confidence level.
I believe that this linear model does a good job of predicting the the mpg of the Mechacar prototypes based on the fact that while only two of the factors had significant values below the null hypothesis, the summary r-squared value is 0.71
